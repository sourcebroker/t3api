SQL "OR" conjunction
=====================

By default ``AND`` conjunction is used between all applied filters but there is a ways to change conjunction to ``OR``. Frontend applications often needs single input field which searches multiple fields. To create such filter it is needed to set same ``parameterName`` for multiple fields. Example code below means that request to URL ``/users?search=john`` will return records where any of the fields (``firstName``, ``middleName``, ``lastName`` or ``address.street``) matches searched text. If we would not determine ``parameterName`` in filter arguments this configuration would work as separate filters for every property.
