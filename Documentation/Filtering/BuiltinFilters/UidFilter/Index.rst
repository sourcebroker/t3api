UidFilter
=========

Should be used to filter items by ``uid`` property. In fact it only extends ``NumericFilter`` but beside adding new condition into SQL's ``WHERE`` clause it also modifies Extbase's Query Settings to make it possible to find translated records by passing default language record ``uid`` value. Modificaion in Query Settings are exactly the same as modifications which are applied when ``\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Persistence\Repository::findByUid`` is called.

An example - if default record ``uid`` is ``8`` and ``uid`` for translated record is ``10`` and you are doing request for translation (:ref:`see how multilanguage worksin t3api <multilanguage>`) then you could add a param ``uid`` with value 8 (``?uid=8`` or ``?uid[]=8``). If you would use ``NumericFilter`` in same example, then it would be needed to set ``uid`` param to ``10`` (otherwise record would not be included in response).

.. important::

   If your site have more than one language it is really recommended to use ``UidFilter`` instead of ``NumericFilter`` on the ``uid`` field.

Syntax: ``?property=<int>`` or ``?property[]=<int>&property[]=<int>``.
