Take a look and test
--------------------

After cloning repo you can run ``ddev restart && ddev composer install`` and then ``ddev ci 12`` to install local integration test instance.
Local instance is available at https://12.t3api.ddev.site/ (login to backend with ``admin`` / ``Password1!`` credentials).

At frontend part you can at once test REST API responses for ext news:

* https://12.t3api.ddev.site/_api/news/news
* https://12.t3api.ddev.site/_api/news/news/1
* https://12.t3api.ddev.site/_api/news/categories
* etc

You can also run Postman test with ``ddev ci:tests:postman`` command or full test suite with ``ddev composer ci``.
Postman is doing full CRUD test with category and news (with image).
